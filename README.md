# Big Data Assignment
This consists of two tasks, Task 1: PySpark Analysis of Nuclear Plants Dataset and Task 2: MapReduce of Margie Travel Dataset.

## Task 1: PySpark Analysis of Nuclear Plants Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the nuclear plants dataset, where various features of a nuclear plant and its values are given. The analysis performed on the dataset is as follows:
1. Remove any null or missing values from the dataset, explain how you handled each column with missing or null values.
2. Find the summary statistics for each group 'Normal' and 'Abnormal' reactors and plot a boxplot for each group.
3. Find the correlation between the features in the dataset by presenting a correlation matrix/heatmap, then discuss the correlation between highly correlated features and their usefulness for further analysis.

## Task 2: MapReduce of Margie Travel Dataset
Two datasets are used for this task, the Margie Travel Dataset and the Top30 airports, which showed flight data to and from airports using their designated airport code, their departure time (in unix epoch time), passenger id's, and time in flight. The analysis performed on the dataset is as follows:
1. Determine the number of flights from each airport in the dataset, then provide a list of any not used.
2. Create a list of flights based on the flightid: number of passengers on each flight, airport codes and departure and arrival times converted to a readable format.
3. Calculate the line of sight (nautical miles) for each flight and the total travelled by each passenger.
4. Output the passenger with the most miles travelled and the passenger.
